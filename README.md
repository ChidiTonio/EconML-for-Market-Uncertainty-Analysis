# EconML-for-Market-Uncertainty-Analysis
Overview
This repository implements hybrid statistical-ML approaches for economic decision modeling that incorporate both economic theory and computational efficiency. The developed models demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting market behaviors under conditions of uncertainty.
 Key Features
- Integration of economic theory constraints with machine learning flexibility
- Uncertainty quantification in economic predictions
- Improved prediction accuracy compared to pure statistical or pure ML approaches
- Interpretable results that align with economic principles
Repository Structure
- `data/`: Economic datasets (raw and processed)
- `models/`: Implementations of statistical, ML, and hybrid models
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the analysis workflow
- `src/`: Source code for the modeling framework
- `docs/`: Documentation on theory, methodology, and results
